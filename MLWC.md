# My Life with Crypto
***
## 1. My journey with shitcoins.

Everything started with safemoon, i found this shitcoin very early but i didn't make much money because i didn't believe that much in him. So in short, i managed to make 200 bucks in addition to the initial investment, which was 600.

I was thinking a lot about people who made a lot of money with safemoon (big shitcoin), so i started trying to found a new shitcoin to put some money in it and make a good profit. I found some shitcoins but they was scams but i managed to make my money back with everrise and make extra too.
So, i put in everrise like 100-150 and i managed to make like 1000. Good profit, right ?
Well, those money didnâ€™t stay that much in my wallet because i was blinded by the money. I was looking to put the money in another shitcoin and this was a pump and dump scheme .... So i lost almost everything, i remained in the wallet with 300 bucks.

## 2. I started to look for real deals in crypto.

As i said, i remained with 300 bucks, so i decided to look in real crypto coins because i want to make my money back without shitcoins, fuck the shitcoins. So, i put a 100 bucks in [CAKE](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap "Pancake Swap") and one friend of mine told me about a token, [BPT](https://blackpool.finance/token "Blackpool Finance"). This token is managed by blackpool finance, some guys who make a lot of money from ntfs. I entered in BPT, with 100 bucks too, and i gave the last 100 to my brother because he needed them, i can't wait to invest them when I receive them.ðŸ˜ˆ

I managed to make a profit with these investments, the profit being $ 70 in a few days. 20 in cake and 50 in bpt, money rain baby. ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸

I will create a table with profit, etc, everytime i write new stuff about my life in crypto, so this is the first one.


|Name   | Investment | Profit | 
|-------| ----       | ----   | 
|CAKE   | 100        | 21     |             
|BPT    | 100        | 50     |                
|BROTHER| 100        | 0      |              

And so far i have succeeded:

- [x]Get rid of shitcoins addiction.
- [ ]To get my money back from losing shitcoins.
- [ ]Make money from crypto and live my life the way i want.

I will come back with new updates every time I do something in crypto.
