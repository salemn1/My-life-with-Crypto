# My Life with Crypto
***
## 1. My journey with shitcoins.

Everything started with safemoon, i found this shitcoin very early but i didn't make much money because i didn't believe that much in him. So in short, i managed to make 200 bucks in addition to the initial investment, which was 600.

I was thinking a lot about people who made a lot of money with safemoon (big shitcoin), so i started trying to found a new shitcoin to put some money in it and make a good profit. I found some shitcoins but they was scams but i managed to make my money back with everrise and make extra too.
So, i put in everrise like 100-150 and i managed to make like 1000. Good profit, right ?
Well, those money didnâ€™t stay that much in my wallet because i was blinded by the money. I was looking to put the money in another shitcoin and this was a pump and dump scheme .... So i lost almost everything, i remained in the wallet with 300 bucks.

## 2. I started to look for real deals in crypto.

As i said, i remained with 300 bucks, so i decided to look in real crypto coins because i want to make my money back without shitcoins, fuck the shitcoins. So, i put a 100 bucks in [CAKE](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap "Pancake Swap") and one friend of mine told me about a token, [BPT](https://blackpool.finance/token "Blackpool Finance"). This token is managed by blackpool finance, some guys who make a lot of money from ntfs. I entered in BPT, with 100 bucks too, and i gave the last 100 to my brother because he needed them, i can't wait to invest them when I receive them.ðŸ˜ˆ

I managed to make a profit with these investments, the profit being $ 70 in a few days. 20 in cake and 50 in bpt, money rain baby. ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸

I will create a table with profit, etc, everytime i write new stuff about my life in crypto, so this is the first one.


|Name   | Investment | Profit | 
|-------| ----       | ----   | 
|CAKE   | 100        | 21     |             
|BPT    | 100        | 50     |                
|BROTHER| 100        | 0      |              

And so far i have succeeded:

- [x]Get rid of shitcoins addiction.
- [ ]To get my money back from losing shitcoins.
- [ ]Make money from crypto and live my life the way i want.

I will come back with new updates every time I do something in crypto.

===================
## Today is 26.08.2021

[BTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin "Bitcoin") price is 47.329 $, and i think a correction will follow.
I decided to take my money out of the [BPT](https://blackpool.finance/token "Blackpool Finance"), 150 bucks, and only let my money in cake, i have hope in cake. 

So what is my strategy ? My strategy is to accumulate more bpt at low prices, i make 50 dollars profit, i take all out and i'm waiting for the price to go down, like as i do right now. I sold at 11-12 $ i think. right now the price is 8.55, and i'm waiting to catch a 7.

With [CAKE](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap "Pancake Swap") I'm fine, the price has dropped a bit, along with btc. I have 118 right now staked for [TRX](https://tron.network/ "Tron"), because even if I made $ 1 or $ 2, maybe one day trx will be up af.

So, this was my day, letâ€™s hope everyone will make some money and that everyone will be healthy and happy.


Just like a friend said:
>Buy some shitcoin for someone and he can lose money one time. Learn him how to use Metamask and DEXes and he can lose forever.
